# Crime Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data research in crime statistics is not a novel concept and its applications as
plentiful as it can offer both broad overviews as well as in depth detailed inferences. The focus of
this term project is to import, process and analyze the Los Angeles Crime Dataset with an
emphasis in data mining. Through exploratory data analysis a further investigation will explore
various aspects of the dataset through graphical visualization of the data.
